Docker Images for Oracle Database
Version: 1.0.0
Updated: 12/20/2015
--------------------------------------------------------------------

This project contains the Dockerfiles and the corresponding directory structures
needed to build Docker containers for Oracle Database.

Docker containers at the time of the writing of this article have a hardcoded
limitation of 64M for shared memory (/dev/shm) on every container. There is a
fix in the experimental release of Docker which should become part of Docker
version 1.10.0 and above. You can read about it here:
https://github.com/docker/docker/issues/16164

Oracle Databases require at least 1GB of shared memory and as such the
[/etc/init.d/oracle-xe configure] command will fail. Therefore, I have used the
Docker 1.10.0-dev Experimental for this build.

To build an image for use, follow the instructions below:

1. Install the Experimental Docker build.
   curl -sSL https://experimental.docker.com/ | sh

2. Update the kernel parameters on the host machine to meet the Oracle
   specifications. The specifications can be found on the webpage here:
   http://docs.oracle.com/cd/E17781_01/install.112/e18802/toc.htm#BABJFAIA

3. Create a base directory for your Docker context.
    mkdir ~/database
    
4. Create the following directories under the Docker context directory. You may
   not need all of these directories depending on the image you are trying to
   build.
    cd ~/database
    mkdir xe
    
5. Download the required software packages into the directories we created in
   the previous step. At the time of the creation of this README, the following
   installers and patched were available. The instruction on where to download
   these files are in READMEs in those directories.
    ~/oracle/db/oracle-xe-11.2.0-1.0.x86_64.rpm.zip

6. Make sure that the files have the appropriate permissions.
    chmod -R go+r ~/database

7. Place the Dockerfile for the image you want to build in the base directory.
    ~/database/xe/Dockerfile.11.2.0.1.0

8. Run the appropriate command to build your image. Use --no-cache=true if you
   do not want to cache intermediate images.
    cd ~/database
    docker build -t oracle/db/xe:11.2.0.1.0 --shm-size=2g \
    -f ~/database/xe/Dockerfile.11.2.0.1.0 .

9. To start a container running the database, run the following command:
    docker run -i -P --shm-size=2g --name=xe-db1 -t oracle/db/xe:11.2.0.1.0
